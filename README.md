# Hey there, I'm Manoj 👋

> *Building AI systems that don't just work—they think, reason, and scale.*

I'm a Machine Learning engineer who gets a kick out of turning messy data into production-ready intelligence. Currently based in Bengaluru, pursuing BTech in Digital Transformation at Atria University with a 9.7 CGPA (yeah, I'm that person who actually enjoys statistics).

## 🎯 What I Actually Do

I architect end-to-end ML systems—from research notebooks to cloud deployments that handle real traffic. My playground includes:

- **Agentic AI workflows** that make autonomous decisions (because single-prompt solutions are so 2022)
- **Deep Learning models** (U-Net, Seq2Seq) for problems where traditional ML just shrugs
- **RAG pipelines** that retrieve, reason, and actually understand context
- **Geospatial ML** for when your data has coordinates and climate concerns

Currently obsessed with making LLMs less hallucinatory and more useful through structured reasoning frameworks.
